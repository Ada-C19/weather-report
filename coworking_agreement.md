# **Coworking Agreement**

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.


## **Accessibility Needs**

_What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?_ 

- Repeat words clearly to check for understanding considering impaired hearing. Proper communication.
- Listen to each other fully before speaking. 


## **Collaboration vs. individual work expectations**

_Clarify your collaboration expectations- does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?_

We will take a divide and conquer approach and come together when we are stuck or when we are both excited about something.


## **Learning Style**

_How does each team member learn best in project settings?_

Explaining approach and talking through the problems. Take some time to understand for yourself and bring any questions or suggestions to the group. 


## **Preferred Feedback Style**

_How does each team member best receive feedback?_

Being direct about what is working and what is not. Acknowledging that we are trying to learn from each other.
